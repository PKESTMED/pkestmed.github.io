  <h1>PrimeLogix – Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 1, 2025</p>

  <p>
    These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the PrimeLogix mobile application
    (the “App”). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
    If you do not agree, you must not use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>
    PrimeLogix is a business application designed to help companies manage logistics operations,
    including inventory, deliveries, routes, sales, and related workflows.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You may use the App only for lawful business purposes.</li>
    <li>You agree not to misuse the App, interfere with its normal operation, or attempt to gain unauthorized access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must provide accurate information when creating an account.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and for all activity under your account.</li>
    <li>If you believe your account has been compromised, you should notify your company admin or contact us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Roles and Company Access</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your role (for example, admin, vendor, driver), you may have different levels of access
    to company data in the App. Your company is responsible for managing which users and roles are authorized
    to access its information.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data and Integrations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The App may store data such as orders, deliveries, inventory, and routes using services like Firebase.</li>
    <li>When configured by your company, the App may integrate with third-party tools such as QuickBooks Online
        to synchronize financial or product information.</li>
    <li>Your use of those third-party services is also subject to their own terms and policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Account Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    You may permanently delete your account directly inside the App. When you do so, your authentication account
    is deleted and your user profile stored in our database is removed, as described in our Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    The App, including its design, features, and content (excluding data entered by your company), is owned by
    PrimeLogix or its licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy,
    modify, distribute, or reverse engineer the App except as permitted by law.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not guarantee that the App will be
    error-free, uninterrupted, or suitable for every purpose. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we
    disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
    particular purpose, and non-infringement.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the extent permitted by law, PrimeLogix and its owners, employees, and partners will not be liable for
    any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits or data,
    arising out of or related to your use of the App or inability to use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to the App and to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update the App or these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we may provide a notice
    within the App or by other reasonable means. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect means
    you accept the updated Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if we believe you have violated these Terms or are using
    the App in a way that may cause harm to us, other users, or third parties. You may stop using the App at any
    time, and you may request account deletion through the in-app deletion feature.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in the jurisdiction where PrimeLogix is operated, without
    regard to conflict of law principles.
