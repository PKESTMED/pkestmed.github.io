  <h1>PrimeLogix – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 1, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how PrimeLogix (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses,
    and protects information when you use the PrimeLogix mobile application
    (the “App”).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on how you use the App, we may collect the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, email address, company name, and role (e.g. admin, vendor, driver).</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication data:</strong> information needed to create and secure your account (for example, stored by Firebase Authentication).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> actions you perform in the App, such as creating routes, recording deliveries, managing inventory, and generating reports.</li>
    <li><strong>Device information:</strong> basic technical information such as device model, operating system, and app version.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The App is designed for business use and does not intentionally collect data from
    individual consumers for marketing or advertising profiling.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information described above to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate the logistics features of the App (routes, inventory, sales, reports).</li>
    <li>Create and manage user accounts and roles.</li>
    <li>Synchronize data with integrated services such as QuickBooks Online, when configured by your company.</li>
    <li>Improve reliability, performance, and security of the App.</li>
    <li>Respond to support requests and communicate important updates about the service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. We may share data only in the following situations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Service providers:</strong> We use third-party providers to host and process data, such as:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Authentication, Firestore database, and related services).</li>
        <li><strong>QuickBooks Online</strong> integration, when your company connects its QuickBooks account to the App.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Business customers:</strong> The App is used by companies to manage their own logistics operations.
      Information entered in the App may be visible to authorized users within your company (for example, admins,
      warehouse staff, and drivers).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or to protect our rights
      and the safety of our users.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain your information for as long as your company maintains an active account and as needed to operate
    the service, comply with legal obligations, and resolve disputes. When data is no longer required, we will
    take reasonable steps to delete or anonymize it.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including secure
    communication (HTTPS) and access controls. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure,
    and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
  <p>You may:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access and update certain account information directly in the App.</li>
    <li>Request that your company admin update or remove information associated with your account.</li>
    <li>Contact us using the details below for questions about your data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for business use and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly
    collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us information,
    please contact us so we can delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on where you are located, your information may be processed in countries that may have different
    data protection laws than your country of residence. We take steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards
    are in place when data is transferred.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the “Last updated”
    date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after any changes means you accept the updated Policy.
